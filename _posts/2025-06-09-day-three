## Monday, June 9 — A Productive Start to the Week

Felt good to finally gain some momentum today. Unlike yesterday, I managed to stay on track and make progress across multiple fronts.

### 📦 Learning & Upskilling

- **Finished** the *Docker for the Absolute Beginner* course (except for the labs).  
  Started the labs, and plan to complete them today. 🧪

- **Started** the **Kubernetes for Beginners** course on [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/) — aiming to wrap it up by tomorrow.  
  It’s a hands-on course and a great prep for CKAD.

- Found some really promising follow-up courses to line up:
  - Jenkins: [Jenkins Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/jenkins-masterclass/)
  - OpenShift: [Learn OpenShift](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-openshift/)
  - Podman: [Podman for Absolute Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/podman-for-the-absolute-beginners-hands-on-devops/)
  - Agentic AI: [Complete Agentic AI Bootcamp with LangGraph & LangChain](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-agentic-ai-bootcamp-with-langgraph-and-langchain/)
  - MLOps: [Mastering Advanced MLOps on GCP](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-advanced-mlops-on-gcp-cicd-kubernetes-kubeflow/)

### 🛠️ Office Work

- Spent time debugging scripts that broke due to our **migration away from Spark**.
- Fixed multiple issues and defects — tough but satisfying.

### 🚀 Tomorrow’s Plan
