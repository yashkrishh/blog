## Friday, June 14 ‚Äî How it's Going


#### üõ†Ô∏è The way ChatGPT wants me to learn:

---

### üîÅ Your Daily Strategy
- Each day, divide your time like this:

#### Coding + SQL Practice (90 mins):

- Practice real-world SQL and Python problems (LeetCode, StrataScratch, or mock datasets).
- Use Snowflake or SQLite locally if needed.

#### System Design + Data Engineering Concepts (90 mins):

- Pick 1‚Äì2 topics: e.g., Airflow DAGs, streaming architecture, or designing a data pipeline.
- Write or draw the architecture and explain it aloud.

#### Mock Interview / Recap / Flashcards (60‚Äì90 mins):

- Summarize what you learned.
- Use a mirror or record yourself to practice articulating.
- Prepare flashcards for services like Kinesis, SQS, etc.

#### Review New Tools / Weak Areas (Optional 30‚Äì60 mins):

- Learn AWS services you don‚Äôt know.
- Read about Kafka, DBT, or Flink ‚Äî but only surface-level unless they come up in your role.

### üìö Topics to Focus On (Prioritized)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSQL + Python	
- How To Approach It : Practice querying Snowflake tables, window functions, CTEs, pivot/unpivot. Build a mini ETL in Python (e.g., CSV ‚Üí clean ‚Üí Snowflake).

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êData Pipeline Design (ETL)	
- How To Approach It : Draw DAGs (Airflow), discuss failure handling, retries, monitoring, backfills. Be ready to design a batch or streaming pipeline.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSnowflake Internals	
- How To Approach It : Learn about Virtual Warehouses, Caching, Clustering, Query Optimizer, Storage Layers. Be able to tune a slow Snowflake query.

‚≠ê‚≠êAirflow	
- How To Approach It : Understand DAGs, tasks, operators, XComs, retries, scheduling.

‚≠ê‚≠êAWS (Kinesis, SQS, SNS)	
- How To Approach It : Learn core use-cases. Know how you‚Äôd stream data from Kafka ‚Üí Kinesis ‚Üí Snowflake.

‚≠ê‚≠êDocker + Cron + Linux	
- How To Approach It : Know how to containerize a job, set cron for it, monitor logs.

‚≠ê‚≠êSystem Design	
- How To Approach It : Know how to scale a data pipeline, design for fault-tolerance, data quality checks, backfilling.

‚≠êMongo, DBT, Flink, Kafka	
- How To Approach It : Know what they are, and basic use-cases. For DBT, understand how to write and run a model.

‚≠êGenAI / DS	
- How To Approach It : Be ready to explain how you‚Äôd integrate GenAI into a data platform (e.g., metadata summarization, anomaly detection, natural language querying).

‚≠êBasic DSA	
- How To Approach It : Focus only on arrays, strings, hashmaps, sorting, and recursion..
