## Tuesday, June 17 â€” Pressure is Building

A senior at work asked me to prepare for an upcoming **MCP-server hackathon** scheduled for **June 26**. With just about a week left, Iâ€™ll be leading the work â€” which is adding more pressure.

At the same time, Iâ€™ve got the **Data Engineering interview** lined up around the same week. On top of it all, thereâ€™s all the **office work Iâ€™ve been putting off**, which is now piling up.

### ðŸ˜“ Feeling the Heat

- Balancing **hackathon planning**, **interview prep**, and **real work deadlines** is already starting to feel overwhelming.
- Need to **prioritize** and take **one thing at a time**.


### What I studied/researched :
