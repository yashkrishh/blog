## Thursday, June 19 — Mental Clutter

Couldn't change focus to Interview preparation fully. Wasted a lot of time.

Tried to pull myself together today, but the mental clutter hasn't cleared.  
Too many things running in parallel, and I’m struggling to focus on any one of them.

The intention to reset is there — just not quite landing yet.
