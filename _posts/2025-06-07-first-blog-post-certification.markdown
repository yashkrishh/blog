# My Certification Roadmap: One Year, Six Milestones 🎯

I've made a decision that I'm really excited about — to **focus the next year on pursuing key certifications** that will help me grow deeper into cloud, data, and AI engineering.

Certifications aren't just about collecting badges — they're about learning **practical, modern skills** that make a difference in real-world systems. Whether it’s orchestrating containers, building AI pipelines, or optimizing cloud-based data platforms, each of these certifications reflects an area I’m passionate about.

---

## 🗓️ One-Year Certification Plan

Here's the roadmap I've laid out for myself:

### 1. 🚢 **CKA – Certified Kubernetes Administrator**
- **Goal Date:** July 21st  
- Kubernetes is the backbone of modern DevOps and microservices. Mastering it will strengthen my ability to deploy, scale, and troubleshoot containerized applications.

---

### 2. 📊 **Databricks Data Engineer Associate/Professional**
- **Goal Date:** September 15th  
- Databricks is transforming how we handle big data and AI workflows. This certification will deepen my knowledge in Spark, Delta Lake, and data engineering at scale.

---

### 3. 🤖 **AWS + AI OR NVIDIA AI Specialist**
- **Goal Date:** November 10th  
- I want to validate my cloud AI knowledge either through **AWS AI/ML certification** or **NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute track**. This one’s all about blending cloud and intelligence.

---

### 4. ☁️ **GCP Data Engineer OR Azure Developer**
- **Goal Date:** January 27th  
- Depending on evolving interests, I’ll either focus on Google’s ML-centric data pipelines or strengthen my Azure development skills. Both are highly relevant for enterprise systems.

---

### 5. ❄️ **Snowflake SnowPro Advanced: Architect**
- **Goal Date:** March 23rd  
- Snowflake remains core to my data warehousing toolkit. Recertifying ensures I'm up-to-date with new features and best practices.

---

### 6. 🔁 **Azure Developer OR GCP Data Engineer (Whichever I didn’t take in Jan)**
- **Goal Date:** May 18th  
- Whichever cloud certification I didn’t take earlier, I’ll complete it here. This will round off my cross-cloud capabilities.

---

## Why This Matters to Me

This isn't just a checklist—it's a growth journey. I want to sharpen both **depth and breadth** across data, cloud, and AI platforms so I can:
- Build smarter systems
- Contribute to impactful projects
- Stay future-proof in a rapidly evolving tech world
