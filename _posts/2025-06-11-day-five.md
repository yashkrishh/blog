## Wednesday, June 11 — Switching Gears for Interview Prep

Pausing **CKAD preparation** temporarily to focus entirely on prepping for my **Data Engineering interview**.
Cleared first round of interview which was yesterday. 
Gave cognitive+personality assessment tests today. 
Next I have two back-to-back 60 minute each technical interviews

### 🎯 Interview Focus Areas

The interview will focus on two key areas:

#### 1. **Programming & Technology**
- I need to sharpen my Python and SQL problem-solving.
- Review coding patterns, edge case handling, and clean code practices.

#### 2. **System Design**
- Deepen understanding of:
  - **System architecture** for scalable data systems
  - **Design patterns** like event-driven, microservices, and batch/stream pipelines
  - Tradeoffs in storage, processing, availability, and latency

---

### 🛠 Plan of Action

- Revise Python fundamentals and practice problems (LeetCode/Easy to Medium)
- Brush up SQL joins, window functions, optimizations
- Explore end-to-end data pipelines (batch + streaming)
- Study system design specifically for data infra
