## Tuesday, June 17 — Pressure is Building

A senior at work asked me to prepare for an upcoming **MCP-server hackathon** scheduled for **June 28**. With just about a week left, I’ll be leading the work — which is adding more pressure.

At the same time, I’ve got the **Data Engineering interview** lined up around the same week. On top of it all, there’s all the **office work I’ve been putting off**, which is now piling up.

### 😓 Feeling the Heat

- Balancing **hackathon planning**, **interview prep**, and **real work deadlines** is already starting to feel overwhelming.
- Need to **prioritize** and take **one thing at a time**.
