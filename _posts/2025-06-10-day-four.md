## Tuesday, June 10 — Interview Insights, Docker Recap

Another busy but enlightening day! Today was less about coding and more about **reflection, review, and research** — all equally important.

### 🧠 Learnings from Interviews

Had a chance to reflect on some **frequent interview questions** and deepen my understanding of what they really test:

1. **What all did you optimize at work?**  
   This question is about **impact** — not just what you did, but **how you improved** something: performance, cost, reliability, latency, or maintainability.

2. **Medallion Architecture**  
   Learned about the **Bronze → Silver → Gold** data layering model in data lakes. Helps structure and clean data in stages, improving quality and lineage tracking.

3. **How much data do you process every schedule?**  
   Important to have **quantifiable metrics** about data volume, frequency, and schedule intervals. Helps interviewers gauge scale and performance handling.

4. **What kind of preprocessing/cleaning/feature engineering do you do?**  
   Need to be clear about data imputation, handling missing values, outliers, scaling, encoding, and domain-specific transformations.

5. **Catalyst Network - Policy Enforcement Pipeline**  
   Explored this Google Gemini resource on **policy enforcement via ETL**:  
   [Catalyst Network - ETL Pipeline](https://g.co/gemini/share/c87b5e8d0be3)
