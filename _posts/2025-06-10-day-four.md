## Tuesday, June 10 — Interview Insights, Docker Recap

### 🧠 Learnings from Interview - 

1. **What all did you optimize at work?**  
2. **Medallion Architecture**  
3. **How much data do you process every schedule?**  
4. **What kind of preprocessing/cleaning/feature engineering do you do?**  
5. **How do you handle failures in a data pipeline?**
6. **New Task at Work – Kinaxis CSV Files via SnowSQL**
7. **Shift from Previous Company**
8. **Data Cleaning**
9. **Snowpark**
10. **Helped Set Up Conjur for Tableau**


## To Learn:
- loading **Kinaxis-generated CSVs** using `snowsql`.
- Add validation + notification on load failure.
- scheduling via **Snowflake Tasks** and parameterized **Stored Procedures**
- **Apache Airflow** for orchestration — retries, alerts, on-failure callbacks.
- External monitoring tools like **CloudWatch**, **PagerDuty**, and **Slack alerts**.
- **idempotent task design** and partial failure handling in DAGs.
- **Snowpark for Python** for writing modular transformation logic.
- **Snowpark** Especially useful when **working with ML models inside Snowflake Cortex**.
- **Data Cleaning** - handling **null values, outlier detection**, and **schema drift**.
- **feature engineering** **feature normalization, encoding**, and column-level lineage tracking.
-**Catalyst Network** - [Policy Enforcement Pipeline](https://g.co/gemini/share/856794509fe6)
- **Data Cleaning** - Great Expectations
- how I helped configure **Conjur (Secrets Manager)** to securely inject database credentials into **Tableau Server**. Used it to rotate Snowflake passwords without redeploying dashboards or scheduled extracts.
- the **tech stack transition**: from mostly on-prem Spark/Hadoop to **cloud-first Snowflake, dbt, Airflow** setup.
- Also a shift in role: From ETL builder to a more **platform + orchestration + analytics** hybrid.
- exploration of **GenAI for unstructured data**.
- trying out **Snowflake Arctic** and studying **agentic AI patterns** via LangGraph.
- **Medallion** : structure and clean data in stages, improving quality and lineage tracking.

### 🚀 Finished Docker Labs today:

- Towards the end, was just searching all the answers online. So need to be more thorough on **Docker Compose, Registry, Networking and Storage**.
