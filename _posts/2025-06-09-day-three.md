## Monday, June 9 — Finished Docker Beginner course without labs

Felt good to finally gain some momentum today. Unlike yesterday, I managed to stay on track and make progress across multiple fronts.

---

### 📦 Learning & Upskilling

- **Finished** the *Docker for the Absolute Beginner* course (except for the labs).  
  Started the labs, and plan to complete them today. 🧪

- **Started** the **Kubernetes for Beginners** course on [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/) — aiming to wrap it up by tomorrow.  
  It’s a hands-on course and a great prep for CKAD.

- Found some really promising follow-up courses to line up:
  - Jenkins: [Jenkins Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/jenkins-masterclass/)
  - OpenShift: [Learn OpenShift](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-openshift/)
  - Podman: [Podman for Absolute Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/podman-for-the-absolute-beginners-hands-on-devops/)
  - Agentic AI: [Complete Agentic AI Bootcamp with LangGraph & LangChain](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-agentic-ai-bootcamp-with-langgraph-and-langchain/)
  - MLOps: [Mastering Advanced MLOps on GCP](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-advanced-mlops-on-gcp-cicd-kubernetes-kubeflow/)

### 🐳 Docker Review

Revisited concepts from the **Docker Beginner Course** and consolidated my learning:  
[My Docker Notes via Gemini](https://g.co/gemini/share/c9955a87cede)

Feeling much more comfortable with:
- Images vs containers
- Dockerfile structure
- Volumes, ports, and environment variables
- Docker Compose basics

---

### 🔍 Cool GitHub Project I Found

Came across this **awesome real-time streaming pipeline project**:
> [Citibike NYC Real-time Data Pipeline](https://github.com/aayushibeniwal/citibike-nyc-data-pipeline)

**Tech Stack**:
- Kafka
- Databricks
- Snowflake

This was a great example of how to tie together **streaming ingestion**, **real-time transformation**, and **cloud-based analytics**.

---

### 🚀 Tomorrow’s Focus

- Finish Kubernetes beginner course
- Start putting together a small personal ETL project inspired by the Citibike pipeline
- Write down optimization examples from past projects

---

### 🛠️ Office Work

- Spent time debugging scripts that broke due to our **migration away from Spark**.
- Fixed multiple issues and defects — tough but satisfying.

---

### 🚀 Tomorrow’s Plan

- Complete the **Docker labs**
- Finish the **Kubernetes beginner course**
- Start prepping for CKAD with hands-on labs
