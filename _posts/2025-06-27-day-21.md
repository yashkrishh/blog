## Friday, June 27 —  Snowflake Interview

Had a Snowflake interview today — and it didn’t go as well as I hoped.  
I knew most of the answers technically, but my **presentation was weak** and I stumbled while explaining them clearly, even when asked to introduce myself. Need to be familiar with **ACCOUNTADMIN-level concepts** .



### What I studied/researched :
