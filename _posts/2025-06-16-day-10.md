## Monday, June 16 â€” Clarity Through the Chaos

Had a productive day at work â€” finally got the green light from my manager to start contributing to a **GenAI project**. Really excited to apply my learning in a real-world scenario.

### ðŸš¨ Role Confusion and Some Disappointment

Today brought a bit of frustration and uncertainty. The interview process Iâ€™m in suddenly showed signs of ambiguity â€” I had applied for a **Senior Data Engineer** role, but the title in communications changed to something like **Sr. Software Engineer**.  

That, combined with the technical focus of the first round (more around **SOLID principles and generic programming**), and the background of the assigned interviewer (more aligned with **Cloud/DevOps**), raised concerns about whether the role matches my expectations and experience.

### ðŸ§­ Refocus

The interview seems extremely difficult now and out of my reach.

Anyway, Iâ€™ve decided to:
- Continue my **original interview prep** focused on Data Engineering and System Design related to Data Engineering.
- Begin preparing seriously for the **AWS Certified Data Engineer â€“ Associate** exam, to deepen my cloud-native data engineering knowledge.
