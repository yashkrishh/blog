## Tuesday, June 18 — MCP Server Day


Tried setting up **MCP servers** today.  
Wasn’t successful with the **Oracle one**, but I think I’ve finally wrapped my head around the **core concept**.

Got a much-needed update today — the upcoming interview will be strictly from a **Data Engineering perspective**.  


The mix of deadlines and expectations is getting frustrating — starting to feel scattered and losing focus. I want to change focus to Interview preparation now.
