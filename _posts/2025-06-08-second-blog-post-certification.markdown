## Sunday, June 8 â€” A Lazy Yet Reflective Day

Wasted most of my time today. Did some office work (even though it is a Sunday) â€” verifying forecast values.

### ðŸ§  Learning

- Decided to take the **CKAD** (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) instead of **CKA**, since Iâ€™m more interested in Kubernetes and **Application Development**, and Iâ€™m a complete newbie in both.
- Iâ€™m very curious to learn how apps are deployed and managed inside Kubernetes.

### ðŸŽ¯ Plan of Action

- As a first step before diving into the [CKAD course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/), I decided to **learn Docker**.
- I'm currently going through this course: [Docker for the Absolute Beginner - Hands On - DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-docker/)
- Spent 2 hours today watching Docker videos â€” no practicals yet.  
- Planning to finish the course **and do the labs** by tomorrow. ðŸš€
