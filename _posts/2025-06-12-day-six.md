## Thursday, June 12 ‚Äî Building Blocks


### üõ†Ô∏è What I Worked On

- Finalizing the **Airflow setup** ‚Äî DAGs, environment config, and local testing. Airflow 3 UI is quite different from earlier ones which are in the videos

---

### üöÄ To do:

Building a **full-fledged ETL pipeline** from scratch. Here's what I want to include:

- **Source:** External **APIs** as data sources (JSON/CSV responses)
- **Ingestion:** Use **AWS Lambda / API Gateway** or direct **cron-based fetch**
- **Streaming (optional):** AWS Kinesis for real-time ingestion (stretch goal)
- **Processing & Orchestration:** **Airflow** + possibly AWS Glue
- **Storage & Query:** **Snowflake** as the data warehouse
- **Transformations:** Use **dbt** or Snowflake‚Äôs native SQL/Snowpark
- **Dashboard:** Lightweight **Streamlit** app or Snowsight for visualization
