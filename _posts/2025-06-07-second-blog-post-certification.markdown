# My Certification Roadmap: One Year, Six Milestones 🎯

## 🗓️ One-Year Certification Plan

Here's the roadmap I've laid out for myself:

### 1. 🚢 **CKA – Certified Kubernetes Administrator**
- **Goal Date:** July 21st  
- Kubernetes is the backbone of modern DevOps and microservices. Mastering it will strengthen my ability to deploy, scale, and troubleshoot containerized applications.

---

### 2. 📊 **Databricks Data Engineer Associate/Professional**
- **Goal Date:** September 15th  
- Databricks is transforming how we handle big data and AI workflows. This certification will deepen my knowledge in Spark, Delta Lake, and data engineering at scale.

---

### 3. 🤖 **AWS + AI OR NVIDIA AI Specialist**
- **Goal Date:** November 10th  
- I want to validate my cloud AI knowledge either through **AWS AI/ML certification** or **NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute track**. This one’s all about blending cloud and intelligence.

---

### 4. ☁️ **GCP Data Engineer OR Azure Developer**
- **Goal Date:** January 27th  
- Depending on evolving interests, I’ll either focus on Google’s ML-centric data pipelines or strengthen my Azure development skills. Both are highly relevant for enterprise systems.

---

### 5. ❄️ **Snowflake SnowPro Advanced: Architect**
- **Goal Date:** March 23rd  
- Snowflake remains core to my data warehousing toolkit. Recertifying ensures I'm up-to-date with new features and best practices.

---

### 6. 🔁 **Azure Developer OR GCP Data Engineer (Whichever I didn’t take in Jan)**
- **Goal Date:** May 18th  
- Whichever cloud certification I didn’t take earlier, I’ll complete it here. This will round off my cross-cloud capabilities.

## 📚 Parallel Learning Tracks

Alongside the certification roadmap, I’m also sharpening my problem-solving and system design skills through daily practice and projects:

- 🔍 **Blind 75 LeetCode** – Revisiting core DSA patterns to strengthen my fundamentals
- 🧮 **SQL + Pandas problems** – Focusing on real-world data wrangling and analytics
- 🏗️ **System Design** – Studying scalable architecture patterns and distributed systems
- ⚡ **Apache Spark Problems** – Practicing transformations, RDD/DataFrame operations, and optimizations
- 🤖 **Applied AI Course** – Deep diving into ML algorithms, model deployment, and AI workflows
- 🧪 **Kaggle Projects** – Applying ML and data engineering to practical datasets and competitions

It’s a packed year — but every hour invested now builds the tech foundation I want to stand on tomorrow.
