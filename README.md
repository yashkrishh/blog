- A full year of **certification goals**
- Daily **coding practice** (DSA, SQL, Spark)
- **System design**, **cloud skills**, and **machine learning**
- Hands-on **Kaggle projects** and real-world problem solving

### 🗓️ What You'll Find Here

- ✅ **Daily learning logs** — Short summaries of what I studied or built that day
- 📈 **Weekly reflections** — Wins, challenges, and key takeaways
- 🎯 **Goal updates** — Progress tracking for my certification timeline
- 🧠 **Mini-guides** — Notes, commands, tips, and code snippets worth sharing

This blog isn’t about perfection — it’s about **showing up every day**, staying consistent, and **learning in public**.
